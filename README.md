# IPL Data Analysis(2008-2019)

Indian Premier League (IPL) is a Twenty20 cricket format league in India. It is usually played in April and May every year. The league was founded by Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI) in 2008. There have been twelve seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders are the Mumbai Indians, who won the 2019 season.

The dataset has been downloaded from [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nowke9/ipldata). The dataset contains two csv files but only one csv file i.e matches.csv has been used in this project for the analysis. The libraries for data analysis and visualization used in this project are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. These libraries are covered in the course by  [Jovian.ml](https://jovian.ml) named as [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](https://jovian.ml/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas). 

As a first step, let's upload our Jupyter notebook to [Jovian.ml](https://jovian.ml).
